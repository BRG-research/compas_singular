Densification
****************************

This example shows how to densify a (coarse) quad mesh into a quad mesh. The datastructures allow to consider quad meshes with optional pseudo-quads to include pole singularities. A pseudo-quad has the geometry of a triangular face (looks like a triangle) but has the topology of a quad face (has four vertices).
