# compas_singular

Welcome to **compas_singular**, a Python library tackles topology finding of patterns, particularly singularities in structured quad meshes.
Based on the [PhD research of Robin Oval](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_singular/latest/07_publications.html), this library implements data structures for quad mesh modelling, several algorithms for topological exploration and interface with Rhino3D/Grasshopper3D.

**compas_singular** is based on the **COMPAS** framework is an open-source, Python-based framework for computational research and collaboration in architecture, engineering, digital fabrication and construction.
